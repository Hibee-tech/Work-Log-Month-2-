# Work-Log-Month-2-June
 🗓 Monthly Worklog – June

 🔧 1. Summary of What I Worked On

Over the past two months, I focused intensively on improving my **JavaScript (including advanced concepts)** and refining my **CSS** skills. I tackled various hands-on projects, especially centered on **building and styling landing pages**. My efforts included DOM manipulation, event handling, form validation, local storage integration, and creating responsive layouts with Flexbox and Grid.


 🏆 2. Achievements.

* ✅ **Built multiple landing pages** completely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* ✅ Designed fully responsive layouts that adapt across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
* ✅ Implemented interactive features like dynamic forms, animations, toggle menus, and task list functionality using pure JavaScript.
* ✅ Improved code reusability by modularizing JavaScript functions and applying DRY principles.
* ✅ Debugged and optimized CSS for cross-browser compatibility.


 ⚠️ 3. Learnings from Failures or Challenges

* ❌ **Struggled with async JavaScript** initially (e.g. `async/await`, promises), especially when dealing with simulated API calls. I overcame this by isolating small test examples and gradually integrating them into my projects.
* ❌ Faced difficulties ensuring **consistent styling across browsers**, particularly with flex alignment and custom fonts. I learned to rely more on reset stylesheets and thoroughly test in multiple browsers.
* ❌ In early versions of my landing pages, I often ignored **accessibility (a11y)** considerations, but I’ve since started using semantic tags and ARIA labels more responsibly.


 🌟 4. Monthly Highlights

* 🎯 Completed two full landing page prototypes, one with a hero section, feature grid, and testimonial area — all built with no frameworks.
* 🚀 Mastered JavaScript event delegation and form input validation without relying on libraries.
* 📚 Began documenting my work using GitHub READMEs, making my code more maintainable and shareable.
* 🧠 Gained deeper understanding of **CSS positioning**, `z-index`, and layering effects for modern UI.
